 Input stream always read
 Output stream always write 
 to write for server it need output stream of client 
 to write for client it need output stream of server 
 
 client has input stream and output stream.
 Client read from output stream what is written in input stream 
 if server write in output stream of server then client can read from input stream 
 same is the case for server 
 
 process  Server
 1 Server get Output stream of client 
 2 Server write in output stream of client 
 3 client read from input stream written by server
