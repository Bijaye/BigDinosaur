Sharding is the process of storing data records 
across multiple machines . As the size of the data 
increases, a single machine may not be sufficient to
 store the data nor provide an acceptable read and write 
 throughput. Sharding solves the problem with horizontal scaling. 
 With sharding, you add more machines to support data growth and the 
 demands of read and write operations.
