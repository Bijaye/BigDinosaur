Definition of data type according to Big Binosaur framework 
Normally java say int for example as data type 
but according to bd concept data type is type how u assume data.
For example collection of positive integer number ranging from 1 to 100 can be considered one data type
lets give it name posotiverange100datatype which is encapsulated in class BdPosotiveRangeDatatype
so similar is the concept .Data is very important and it resemblies different data type .

language provides capability to distinguish some of the data like int,float ,bigdecimal but user specific ,busniness specific data type is more important

Google Search
You Tube Search
Facebook search 

what next 
all search in same ui
SO MORE tab for search one UI wwith all search capability

Single page ni more tags geting data for google from face book and vice versa 

There are lots of work need to be rework to create a better user experience. Unnecessary data load ,unnecessary click ,repetitive unnecessary actions to get information  need to be reduced.it would be better if same screen for all information.Data presentation should be based on pattern of data user want to see.Page UI must be intelligence enough to customize data and return right information on the basis of user regex  searching on but not on the basis of generic page for all users. 

shoulbe able to put content in repo


In single page i want to load all information i need


I must have repo for all types of data ,user can select to send data to which repo
suppose i google and found on it and want to save it on some place 
it should be have folder for education
finance and so on ,so that i can see l;ater

Case I:
read every lines of file
take out every character 
encrypt every character n put in another file
n again decrypt and get original character

for example 
there is character 
my name is abishkar 
take out 

Character map reduce 
map

      -----------> reduce 
1 y
m

1 n
1 a 
        -----------> reduce
1 m 
1 e

n
a
m

1 i
  -----------> reduce

1 s

map 1 to cluster machine capacity each
for example
no of maps=1000 maps
map represnets reduced each line of text file 
list.add(map1)
list.add(map1)
list.add(map1000)
