The goal of any supervised learning algorithm is to find a function that best maps a set of inputs to its correct output.
For example there is a method that is called for particular use case and data is retrived on the  basis of machine learning 
data ads to display for particular group and user 
int getMachineLearningValueOfuser(User user)--here theer are expecial fields say more than 100 flags and on the basis of data that is set on 100 flags we can learn the pattern 
int getParticularGroupOfAddOnTheBasisOfMachineLearningValue(int );
List<>getAdsOnthebasisOfAddGroup(int )

Second alternative 
max no of assumption variable is valid
int assumptionaboutdisese;
if assumptionaboutdisese is greater than 2 against checking disease name from list
there are arraylist of disease 
iterate array 
for every disease name pattern match with text file ,
if that disese name is there in text file ,simple assumption is that it is disease
