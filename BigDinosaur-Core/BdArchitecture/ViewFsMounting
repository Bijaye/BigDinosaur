 Make  user and data dirs - we creates links to them in the mount table
There are 4  directories as user,data,dir2,dir3,aFile
  fcTarget.mkdir(new Path(targetTestRoot,"user"),
        FileContext.DEFAULT_PERM, true);
    fcTarget.mkdir(new Path(targetTestRoot,"data"),
        FileContext.DEFAULT_PERM, true);
    fcTarget.mkdir(new Path(targetTestRoot,"dir2"),
        FileContext.DEFAULT_PERM, true);
    fcTarget.mkdir(new Path(targetTestRoot,"dir3"),
        FileContext.DEFAULT_PERM, true);
    FileContextTestHelper.createFile(fcTarget, new Path(targetTestRoot,"aFile"));
    
    
    Now create mount file system to make up link with user and dir
    
    mount file system make link with actual file system 
    
    
    target file system is referenced from mount file system 
    
    client access mount file system 
    opt/pd0/sitedata
    opt/pd0/organizationdata
    opt/pd0/containerdata
    sitedata ,organizationdata,containerdata is mount points 
    These mount points to another file system defined by path
