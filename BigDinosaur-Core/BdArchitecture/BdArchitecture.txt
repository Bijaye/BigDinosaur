BdtreeMultipleNode has many BdFileDirSingleVm-- 

BdTreeClusterNode has many BdtreeMultipleNode--same concept as BdtreeMultipleNode

---------------------for .net package -------------

host1=r1,host2=r1,host3=r2

on the basis of host name return rack ,different host name using same rack.
It is very important to understand how many racks are there in all hosts .


Streams time out ,
Stream with a given timeout 
list of hosts dependent on the provided host name.
One host is dependent on another host 


Node name 
Node location 
Data center
Rack

/dog/orange
dog is data center and orange is rack 
string representation of its
String representation of network location is /dog/orange

leaves represent data nodes (computers) and inner
 * nodes represent switches/routers that manage traffic in/out of data centers,
 * racks or physical host (with virtual switch).

Adding and removing node from ClusterMap 

Point of replica and dependent DNS 
1 There are dependent DNS-names for a given DNS-name/IP-address
2.Dependent DNs -names fall in same domain group .
3.When creating replica it helps by finding dependent group
4 compute server runs VMs
5.compute server uses shared memory 
6There is directly attached storage also 
7.Data node falls in 2 domains 
8.One domain is defined by compute server   
9.Another domain is defined by attached storage
10 With node group data nodes can be grouped based on server fault domain storag
11 It can also can be grouped based on storage fault domain 
12 Cross node dependencies help in block placement to ensure two replica will be on two dependent nodes 


On passing host name must get the dependent nodes 

Every node has parent node 
Node in a network topology






for example 
host1 and host 2
Switch 
Rack 
Node 
Host name
Host address
