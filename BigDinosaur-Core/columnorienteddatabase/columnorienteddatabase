In column oriented database there is table 
say suppose table name is User 
User has two column family 
personal data and professional data 
 in table user in column family personal data  there are 2 attributes 
 name and city

 ypes of Partitioning
There are two types of partitioning available in redis. Suppose we have four redis instances R0, R1, R2, R3 and many keys representing users like user:1, user:2, ... and so forth

Range Partitioning
Range partitioning is accomplished by mapping ranges of objects into specific Redis instances. Suppose in our example users from ID 0 to ID 10000 will go into instance R0, while users form ID 10001 to ID 20000 will go into instance R1 and so forth.

Hash Partitioning
In this type of partitioning, a hash function (eg. modulus function) is used to convert key into a number and then data is stored in different- different redis instances.
