Update1:Every BigDinosaur Framework objects must possess BdCore characteristics
BdCore as main interface is finalized
Analyzing the pattern till now data structure takes 1 level branch of tree .
BFileRow and NTableNode classes can be considered for tree nodes .BfileRow has pointing reference to  NTableNode

Algorithm version 0.0
1 Start master node
2.Start Slaves node
3.Copy files from normal location of files to BDfilesystem.It exists in master node but has reference to all slave filesyetm.Say suppose exists 100 files
4.Read no of map value .Say suppose map=10.Then distribute 100/10 files into slave clusters.BdSlave class represent it.
5.File is distributed on locations slave cluster file system .It is part of BDDfs.
6.Processing starts on the basis of map reduce business logic 
7.Access to read and write is done via master .If client want to delete blocks ,read blocks i.e i.o operations then client access master and master calls slave 
8.Acl is applied on this session
