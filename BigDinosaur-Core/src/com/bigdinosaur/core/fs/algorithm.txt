algorithm.tx has bytes of 100000
Fs function is that it can accept only 1000000 bytes and there can be 1000 no of blocks file
min byte=0 and max byte= 1000000
File data is stored in blocks 
no of blocks size  is given by filesize/no of block 
so size of each block=100000/10;
where 10 is no of bloks
so we can create 10000 size of block with no of bloks=10

So there are 10 blocks with size 10000

if again the bloks size is greater than 1000000 say suppose 100000000 then again this block is 
divided into 1000 blocks with each holding of size 1000000

For 10 no of blocks there are 10 arrays 
In 10 blocks data are splitted and put in array
