 bitmap, bitset, bit string, or bit vector
 WeakHashMap
hashing functions

If the element is not in the bloom filter, then we know for sure we don't need to perform the expensive lookup. On the other hand, if it is in the bloom filter, we perform the lookup,

Bloom filter before searching make sure data is present on that data structure or not ,If that is present then only search that data
